---

The band reimagines its medium: fewer guitars, more ghosts in the machine.

## Track notes (highlights)
- Everything in Its Right Place — looping voice fragments; became an opener that reconfigured rooms.
- The National Anthem — fuzz bass + free-jazz horns; a controlled detonation.
- How to Disappear Completely — strings drift; title taken from a tour mantra.
- Idioteque — sample collage and stark climate dread; dancefloor and panic attack in one.

### Fun facts
- Early web ephemera for this era mixed cryptic graphics with numbered clues and “errata.”
- Live shows used on-the-fly sampling of vocals and crowd noise into new textures.

### Notable live moments
- The National Anthem’s live horns became a ritual crescendo.
- Idioteque emerged as a set-closing staple.
